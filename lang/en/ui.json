  "Calendar of ideas for Lille": "Citizen ideas",
  "Volt is a movement": "Volt is a movement of citizens from all over Europe who volunteer to work towards a more progressive, participatory and pan-European way of doing politics - with an emphasis on redefining what ecological principles, solidarity and democracy should mean in the 21st century.",
  "With this calendar": "With this calendar we want to present a selection of proposals for the future of Lille - collected in workshops and citizen participation projects here and elsewhere in Europe.",
  "We are a movement": "Our movement is also a political party. With a programme but without candidates. Our goal for themunicipalities in Lille is to find citizens who want to carry these ideas to the city council - Twenty 'courageous' on the first places and witnesses to complete the list.",

  "Green Band": "A Green Band",
  "Develop a new green band": "Develop a new green strip through Lille by covering the A1/A22/A25/N356 motorways with a roof and green park above. Similar efforts are underway in other cities to add green spaces, significantly reduce air pollution and noise. For Lille, this strip and park are also a natural means of connection with the Fives and Lille Sud districts and the most natural footbridges at Lillenium, between Fives Cail and Saint Sauveur and between Parc Matisse and the Jardin de Géants.",
  "In absence of": "In the absence of alternatives and space, it is necessary to imagine",
  "Certainly an ambitious project": "Certainly an ambitious idea, but given the lack of available space and the motorway cutting Lille apart, such a project could address multiple issues: provide a large-scale recreational green space, connect the different quarters of the city, reduce noise and air pollution. It is space, the city can make available and a potential landmark project for Lille.",

  "Convert Vieux Lille into": "Convert Old Lille into a pedestrian zone and the interior of Lille between D651/D750/D749 in a wake-free zone (reduced speed, air crit'<3) of ultra-low emission (ULEZ) by replacing streets with sidewalks, trees and cycle paths and installing free electric shuttle lanes in the city centre for elderly and disabled people.",

  "More and more cities": "More and more cities are trying to cope with ever increasing traffic, congestion and air pollution. In Lille, which counts 1700 deaths due to air pollution per year, the situation is exacerbated by the lack of available space to install vegetation.",
  "The one variable": "The one variable that is available is inner-city car parking space. Reducing the number of car parks would free space for pedestrians, bike lanes and green space. Reducing the number of car trips into Lille will reduce air pollution. Requiring tolls per entry for cars and trucks will help finance a free public transportion.

  "Soon here the need for living space": "Soon. Here. The need for space to breathe.",
  "The need for additional": "The need for additional housing is unquestionable. But why are we building concrete sleeping quarters instead of communities that we can live in ? Where is the local infrastructure (the restaurants, the shops, the public services and transport in close proximity) that allow us to live in Lille without requiring a car ?Sites like around Port de Valenciennes or on Rue Faubourg de Roubaix will only exacerbate the desperation of inhabitants for more green space and livelihood, because the concrete towers they dwell in provide non of these and this needs to change.",

  "A form of local money": "A form of local money could for example support a local deposit scheme for bottles and recyclables with deposits being paid out in local money. The same would work towards ensuring free public transport benefits Lille citizens by paying an reimboursement for public transport usage  (1€ par trajet up to a monthly subscription). It ensures that local infrastructure benefits residents and local investments circulate locally.",

  "Make free public transport possible": "Make free public transport possible by using 50% reimbursement of home-work transport costs and offering the other 50% reimbursement for the use of Ilieva network - for example with €1 reimbursed per trip up to 50% of the subscription - so a sustainable free as long as the transport is used.",

Finally, for foreigners living in Lille, it would be an easy means to prove residency to their home-country government.",

Payer une prime pour les emballages enregistrés dans la vente au détail (ou ceux qui sont retourner par les SDF) et facturer ces primes aux commerçants pour les inciter à réduire l'emballage. Cesser graduellement la collection d'ordures recyclables en parallel.",
  "While deposits for recyclables": "Ainsi qu'un système de consigne soit difficile à mettre en place au niveau national, Lille peut encore aller de l'avant et donner l'exemple. Le système proposé ne devrait pas pénaliser les citoyens, mais plutôt les inciter à collecter et à retourner les produits recyclables. Les dépôts peuvent être crédités en monnaie locale/pour l'utilisation des services publics locaux afin de s'assurer qu'ils continuent à circuler dans la région lilloise. Le coût du système devrait être facturé aux détaillants qui mettent ces matériaux en circulation - sous forme de frais forfaitaires basés sur un volume approximatif ou avec un taux réduit pour les détaillants participants qui veulent travailler en collaboration avec la ville afin de minimiser les déchets d'emballage.",

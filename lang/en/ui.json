Similar efforts are underway in other cities to add green spaces, significantly reduce air pollution and noise. For Lille, this strip and park are also a natural means of connection with the Fives and Lille Sud districts and the most natural footbridges at Lillenium, between Fives Cail and Saint Sauveur and between Parc Matisse and the Jardin de Géants.",
  "In absence of": "In the absence of alternatives and space, it is necessary to imagine",
  "Certainly an ambitious project": "Certainly an ambitious idea, but given the lack of available space and the motorway cutting Lille apart, such a project could address multiple issues: provide a large-scale recreational green space, connect the different quarters of the city, reduce noise and air pollution. It is space, the city can make available and a potential landmark project for Lille.",

  "More and more cities": "More and more cities are trying to cope with ever increasing traffic, congestion and air pollution. In Lille, which counts 1700 deaths due to air pollution per year, the situation is exacerbated by the lack of available space to install vegetation.",
  "The one variable": "The one variable that is available is inner-city car parking space. Reducing the number of car parks would free space for pedestrians, bike lanes and green space. Reducing the number of car trips into Lille will reduce air pollution. Requiring tolls per entry for cars and trucks will help finance a free public transportion.

  "Soon here the need for living space": "Soon. Here. The need for space to breathe.",

Where is the local infrastructure (the restaurants, the shops, the public services and transport in close proximity) that allow us to live in Lille without requiring a car ?Sites like around Port de Valenciennes or on Rue Faubourg de Roubaix will only exacerbate the desperation of inhabitants for more green space and livelihood, because the concrete towers they dwell in provide non of these and this needs to change.",

Gradually phase out the collection of recyclable waste in parallel.",
  "While deposits for recyclables": "While deposits for recyclables are difficult to establish on national level, Lille can still go forward and set a positive example. The proposed system should not penalize citizens but rather motivate to collect and return recyclable goods. Deposits can be credited in local currency/for use of local public services to ensure they keep circulating in the Lille area. The cost of the system should be charged to retailers who bring these materials into circulation -as flatrate charge based on approximate volume or with a reduced rate for participating retailers who want to work togehter with the city to minimize packaging waste.",

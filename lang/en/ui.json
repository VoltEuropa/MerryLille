Similar efforts are underway in other cities to add green spaces, significantly reduce air pollution and noise. For Lille, this strip and park are also a natural means of connection with the Fives and Lille Sud districts and the most natural footbridges at Lillenium, between Fives Cail and Saint Sauveur and between Parc Matisse and the Jardin de Géants.",
  "In absence of": "In the absence of alternatives and space, it is necessary to imagine",
  "Certainly an ambitious project": "Certainly an ambitious idea, but given the lack of available space and the motorway cutting Lille apart, such a project could address multiple issues: provide a large-scale recreational green space, connect the different quarters of the city, reduce noise and air pollution. It is space, the city can make available and a potential landmark project for Lille.",

  "More and more cities": "More and more cities are trying to cope with ever increasing traffic, congestion and air pollution. In Lille, which counts 1700 deaths due to air pollution per year, the situation is exacerbated by the lack of available space to install vegetation.",
  "The one variable": "The one variable that is available is inner-city car parking space. Reducing the number of car parks would free space for pedestrians, bike lanes and green space. Reducing the number of car trips into Lille will reduce air pollution. Requiring tolls per entry for cars and trucks will help finance a free public transportion. Car parking is thus a main lever for putting Lille on to a greener tracetory.",
  "and since there are more propositions": "... and since we have more propositions, we will continue until the end of the year."
